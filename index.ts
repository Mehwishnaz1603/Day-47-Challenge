//Question 139: List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each.
let counting = 5;       // Reserved word: let - used to declare a block-scoped local variable
if (counting > 0) { // Reserved word: if - used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true
console.log("Counting is greater than 0.") };
function add(a, b) {// Reserved word: return - used to exit a function and return a value from that function
    return a + b };

//Question 140: Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word as a variable name.
//let if = 10; // This line would cause a syntax error
console.log("Using a reserved word as a variable name causes a syntax error in JavaScript.");
  
//Question 141: Discuss the significance of the await reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript.
async function fetchData() {
    // Assuming fetchSomething returns a Promise
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
    // The 'await' keyword pauses the execution until the Promise settles, and then resumes with the resolved value.
  }
  console.log
  ("The 'await' keyword allows asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner, more linear fashion.");
